/*
 * Sprockets provides some directives that are placed inside of comments called require,
 * require_tree, and require_self. DO NOT USE THEM IN YOUR SASS/SCSS FILES.
 * They are very primitive and do not work well with Sass files.
 * Instead, use Sass's native @import directive which sass-rails has customized to integrate
 * with the conventions of your Rails projects.
